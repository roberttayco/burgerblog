     <p class="copy">I will fully admit that I don’t hide my hatred for over-hyped restaurants on the strip or failed areas of town like Tivoli Village, so it was with great hesitation that I took a few recent suggestions to go try the burger at View Wine Bar. Many restaurants and stores have come and gone from this ghost town of a shopping area, and I question how long anything could survive there based on how few people are around each time I visit. Because no one is ever there I typically assume that this means there’s nothing worthy of perusing or devouring here, but after my most recent visit I couldn’t be more wrong.

      <p>As an architect by day and burger connoisseur by night, Erik is on a quest to track down the perfect burger in a city where excess is king and tourists expect the best.</p>
      <p>Inspired by his brother, his journey begins to find that one burger that every local doesn’t want anyone to know about, and every tourist wants to come home and brag about. With casinos constantly in competition to launch the best burger joint and stay ahead of the rest, his goal is to sample every place that serves a burger in this huge city and put them to the test.</p>
      <p>Follow his journey as he gives you the only opinion that really matters: his.</p>
