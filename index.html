         <h2>View Wine Bar</h2>
         <p><em>by</em> <a href="#">Erik Chudy</a> <em>on</em> March 10, 2013</p>
         <p class="copy">I will fully admit that I don’t hide my hatred for over-hyped restaurants on the strip or failed areas of town like Tivoli Village, so it was with great hesitation that I took a few recent suggestions to go try the burger at View Wine Bar. Many restaurants and stores have come and gone from this ghost town of a shopping area, and I question how long anything could survive there based on how few people are around each time I visit. Because no one is ever there I typically assume that this means there’s nothing worthy of perusing or devouring here, but after my most recent visit I couldn’t be more wrong.</p>

         <h2>Nobhill Tavern</h2>
         <p><em>by</em> <a href="#">Erik Chudy</a> <em>on</em> March 4, 2013</p>
         <p class="copy">This meal deserves a full review due to both the longevity of this restaurant in Vegas as well as the quality, but you only have until the end of the month before it closes for good so I’ll keep it short and give you time to get there. Nobhill has been in the MGM Grand for over 12 years now and recently announced their closure to make way for a new venue in a couple months. Known for a killer happy hour, they serve a burger on this menu that has somehow gone under my radar until recently. I only wish I was told about this burger earlier.</p>
